# Deeplearning_Gene_classfication
In this study, we obtained a reliable deep learning model based on CNN and RNN, which can help to predict the corn annular RNA sequence.
The training data is composed of the sequences of B73 and MO17, two different corn materials.
Tere are 3w of them,For the interpretability of the model, each level of convolution kernel in CNN structure can be regarded as motif scanner, and we applied visual method to find the motif that the model learned.
